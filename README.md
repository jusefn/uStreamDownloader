## Given that I am no longer enrolled in the University of Vienna, this repository is now archived and I no longer see a personal reason/use for this project. 

# uStreamDownloader
Downloads U:Stream lecture streams from the University of Vienna, Austria

## To Build:
You need the .NET Core 3.0 SDK which can be downloaded here:
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
You will also need the ffmpeg executable, which can be downloaded here: https://ffmpeg.org/

## To Use:
The ID of a stream can be found after the `&id=` part in a URL like this: `https://ustream.univie.ac.at/media/core.html?format=hls&id=`
You can add multiple IDs which will be downloaded consecutively.

## Disclamer:
This software should not be used with the intention to violate the copyrights of the University of Vienna and should only be used by those who have been enrolled for personal use. The creator is not associated with the Vienna University Computer Center (ZID) in any way. Use at your own risk.
